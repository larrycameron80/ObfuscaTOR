The intended goal of this library is to allow easy development of social media plugins
to display Tor bridge information to the mass public without computers being able to easily 
record and filter those bridge addresses.


I keep using the term 'CAPTCHA' to describe this, which I understand is incorrect.
I'm not challenging anyone to solve a test, and this has nothing to do with authentication.
The term 'CAPTCHA' is, however, recognized as 'Those pictures with letters that computers
aren't supposed to be able to read'. That is why I am using it. Also, all the graphics
rendering I've taken from Captcha libraries. Maybe we'll think of something more correct later.


I've taken from the Easy Captcha library and the PHP Captcha libraries for all the
algorithms. I've made a few modifications to allow for linebreaks and to remove some
of the things not needed for this implementation. Other then that, all the credit really
goes to the developers of those libraries.

What I've added is the interface and captcha factory in an effort to make it easy to
extend this system. Please see index.php for example usages.
